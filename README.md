# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, making its prevention a critical priority. Data-driven systems for predicting heart disease can significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, ultimately contributing to healthier lives. Machine Learning (ML) offers powerful tools for predicting heart disease with remarkable accuracy.



## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a heart disease patient dataset, followed by proper data processing. Several ML models are then trained to predict heart disease using different algorithms, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and more.

The models predict the presence of heart disease based on various input features. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable indicates whether heart disease is present or not.
